== _FINALLY, A RUBY CLIENT FOR MAP TP!_

* http://github.com/ffwdme/maptp-service

== DESCRIPTION:

This gem provides access to the MapTP web services.

In order to use them, you need your MapTP credentials aka your Map24 id.

For more information head over to http://www.nn4d.com

*Note*: This is *not* an official client of MapTP or NAVTEQ, but a private project. :)

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* At this point, only a very simple routing request is implemented.
* more to come...
 
== SYNOPSIS:

Given, you have two coordinates to create a route for:

    start_coordinate = { :lat => 49.945589, :lng => 8.845563 }
    destination_coordinate = { :lat => 49.936982, :lng => 8.911113 }

Just create a new routing object:

    routing = MapTP::Routing.new

And try to find the matching route:

    route = routing.find_route_by_coordinates start_coordinate, destination_coordinate

== REQUIREMENTS:

* The savon SOAP client (http://github.com/rubiii/savon)

== INSTALL:

    sudo gem install maptp-service
